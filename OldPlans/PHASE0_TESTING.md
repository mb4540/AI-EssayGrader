# Phase 0 Testing Checklist

**Phase:** Fix Annotation Category Inconsistency
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL BUG FIXED - Ready for Re-Testing
**Date:** November 30, 2025
**Last Updated:** November 30, 2025 4:10pm

## ⚠️ CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED AND FIXED

**Issue Found During Manual Testing:**
- Specific Corrections section was EMPTY
- Inline Annotations section was EMPTY
- Annotations were being rejected by validation

**Root Cause:**
- `validateCategory()` in `normalizer.ts` was still checking for hardcoded generic categories
- New rubric criterion IDs (e.g., `ideas_development`) failed validation
- ALL annotations went to `unresolved` array instead of being saved

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `validateCategory()` to accept any non-empty string
- Changed `AnnotationCategory` type to `string`
- Commit: `f12af41`

1. Replaced generic annotation categories with rubric criterion IDs in LLM prompts
2. Fixed annotation validation to accept dynamic rubric criterion IDs

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Database
- [x] No database changes required

### ⚪ Backend Testing

#### Test 1: Grade with Standard ELAR Rubric
- [ ] Run local dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate to Grade Submissions page
- [ ] Select or create assignment with ELAR rubric (IDEAS & DEVELOPMENT, FOCUS & ORGANIZATION, AUTHOR'S CRAFT, CONVENTIONS)
- [ ] Grade a submission
- [ ] **Verify:** All annotations use criterion IDs (e.g., `ideas_development`)
- [ ] **Verify:** NO generic categories appear (Content, Clarity, Mechanics)
- [ ] **Verify:** NO rubric display names appear (IDEAS & DEVELOPMENT)
- [ ] Check Netlify function logs for errors

#### Test 2: Grade with Different Rubric Type
- [ ] Create assignment with math/science rubric (different criteria)
- [ ] Grade a submission
- [ ] **Verify:** Annotations use the NEW rubric's criterion IDs
- [ ] **Verify:** System adapts to different rubric structure

#### Test 3: Pass 1 Annotations
- [ ] Grade submission
- [ ] Check browser console for LLM response
- [ ] **Verify:** Pass 1 annotations use rubric criterion IDs
- [ ] **Verify:** No generic categories in Pass 1

#### Test 4: Pass 2 Annotations
- [ ] Grade submission with rubric criteria that score < max points
- [ ] **Verify:** Pass 2 annotations use rubric criterion IDs
- [ ] **Verify:** criterion_id field matches category field

#### Test 5: Comparison Mode
- [ ] Grade submission with rough draft and final draft
- [ ] **Verify:** Comparison mode annotations use rubric criterion IDs
- [ ] **Verify:** No generic categories in comparison mode

### ⚪ Frontend Testing

#### Test 6: VerbatimViewer Display
- [ ] Open graded submission
- [ ] **Verify:** Annotations display correctly
- [ ] **Verify:** Hover tooltips work
- [ ] **Verify:** No console errors

#### Test 7: AnnotationViewer Display
- [ ] View "Specific Corrections" section
- [ ] **Verify:** Headers match rubric criterion IDs
- [ ] **Verify:** Grouping by criterion works correctly

#### Test 8: Print View
- [ ] Print graded submission
- [ ] **Verify:** Annotations display correctly
- [ ] **Verify:** Headers are consistent
- [ ] **Verify:** No layout issues

### ⚪ Integration Testing

#### Test 9: Consistent Headers Across Sections
- [ ] Grade submission
- [ ] Compare headers in:
  - Detailed Breakdown
  - Specific Corrections
  - Inline Annotations
- [ ] **Verify:** ALL sections use same criterion IDs
- [ ] **Verify:** No discrepancies between sections

#### Test 10: Multiple Rubrics
- [ ] Grade with ELAR rubric - note criterion IDs
- [ ] Grade with math rubric - note criterion IDs
- [ ] Grade with science rubric - note criterion IDs
- [ ] **Verify:** Each rubric's criterion IDs are used correctly
- [ ] **Verify:** No cross-contamination between rubrics

### ⚪ Production Smoke Test

#### Test 11: Deploy to Production
- [ ] Merge to main branch
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor Netlify deployment logs
- [ ] **Verify:** No deployment errors

#### Test 12: Production Grading Test
- [ ] Grade 1 submission in production
- [ ] **Verify:** Consistent headers across all sections
- [ ] **Verify:** No generic categories
- [ ] Check Netlify function logs for errors
- [ ] **Verify:** No user-facing errors
