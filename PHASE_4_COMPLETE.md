# Phase 4: Protected API Endpoints - Complete

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: October 26, 2025

---

## Overview

All existing API endpoints have been updated with authentication and tenant isolation. Users can now only access their own data, and all endpoints require valid JWT tokens.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Middleware ✅

**File**: `netlify/functions/lib/auth.ts`

**Added Functions:**
```typescript
// Authenticate request and extract user/tenant info
export async function authenticateRequest(
  authHeader: string | undefined
): Promise<AuthenticatedRequest>

// Optional authentication (doesn't throw on missing token)
export async function optionalAuthentication(
  authHeader: string | undefined
): Promise<AuthenticatedRequest | null>
```

**What It Does:**
- Extracts JWT token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Verifies token signature and expiration
- Fetches current user from database
- Checks if user is active
- Returns user data and tenant_id for filtering

---

### 2. Protected Endpoints

#### `ingest.ts` ✅
**Changes:**
- Added authentication check
- Added CORS headers with Authorization support
- Filter students by `tenant_id` when finding/creating
- Filter assignments by `tenant_id` when finding/creating
- Verify assignment belongs to tenant before using
- Return 401 for missing/invalid tokens

**Tenant Isolation:**
- Students can only be created/found within user's tenant
- Assignments can only be created/found within user's tenant
- Cross-tenant assignment references are rejected

---

#### `grade.ts` ✅
**Changes:**
- Added authentication check
- Added CORS headers with Authorization support
- Join with `students` table to filter by `tenant_id`
- Return 404 if submission not found OR doesn't belong to tenant
- Return 401 for missing/invalid tokens

**Tenant Isolation:**
- Can only grade submissions that belong to tenant's students
- Cross-tenant grading attempts return 404 (not 403 to avoid enumeration)

---

#### `list.ts` ✅
**Changes:**
- Added authentication check
- Added CORS headers with Authorization support
- Added `tenant_id` filter to ALL query variations (12 different queries)
- Return 401 for missing/invalid tokens

**Tenant Isolation:**
- All submissions filtered by `st.tenant_id = ${tenant_id}`
- Search results only include tenant's data
- Assignment/student filters work within tenant scope
- Pagination counts only tenant's submissions

---

#### `save-teacher-edits.ts` ✅
**Changes:**
- Added authentication check
- Added CORS headers with Authorization support
- Join with `students` table to verify tenant ownership
- Return 404 if submission not found OR doesn't belong to tenant
- Return 401 for missing/invalid tokens

**Tenant Isolation:**
- Can only edit submissions that belong to tenant's students
- Cross-tenant edit attempts return 404

---

## Security Features

### Authentication
- ✅ JWT token required for all endpoints
- ✅ Token extracted from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- ✅ Token signature verified
- ✅ Token expiration checked (7 days)
- ✅ User active status verified
- ✅ Returns 401 Unauthorized for invalid/missing tokens

### Tenant Isolation
- ✅ All database queries filtered by `tenant_id`
- ✅ Students scoped to tenant
- ✅ Assignments scoped to tenant
- ✅ Submissions scoped to tenant (via student relationship)
- ✅ Cross-tenant access attempts return 404 (not 403)
- ✅ Foreign key constraints prevent data leakage

### CORS
- ✅ Proper CORS headers on all endpoints
- ✅ `Authorization` header allowed
- ✅ OPTIONS preflight handled
- ✅ Supports authenticated requests from frontend

---

## Frontend Integration Required

### Update API Client

**File**: `src/lib/api.ts` (or wherever API calls are made)

**Add Authorization Header:**
```typescript
// Get token from AuthContext
const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');

// Add to all API requests
const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/ingest', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,  // ← Add this
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
```

### Handle 401 Responses

```typescript
if (response.status === 401) {
  // Token expired or invalid
  // Clear auth and redirect to login
  localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
  localStorage.removeItem('auth_user');
  window.location.href = '/login';
}
```

---

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] **Login and get token**
  - Login at `/login`
  - Verify token in localStorage
  
- [ ] **Test ingest endpoint**
  - Create submission with valid token
  - Verify submission created
  - Try without token → expect 401
  - Try with invalid token → expect 401

- [ ] **Test grade endpoint**
  - Grade submission with valid token
  - Verify grade saved
  - Try to grade another tenant's submission → expect 404
  - Try without token → expect 401

- [ ] **Test list endpoint**
  - List submissions with valid token
  - Verify only own submissions returned
  - Try without token → expect 401

- [ ] **Test save-teacher-edits endpoint**
  - Edit submission with valid token
  - Verify edits saved
  - Try to edit another tenant's submission → expect 404
  - Try without token → expect 401

- [ ] **Test tenant isolation**
  - Create 2 test users in different tenants
  - Create submissions for each
  - Verify User A cannot see User B's submissions
  - Verify User A cannot grade User B's submissions
  - Verify User A cannot edit User B's submissions

## Database Schema Notes

### Tenant Relationships

```
tenants (tenant_id)
  ↓
students (tenant_id FK)
  ↓
submissions (student_ref FK)

tenants (tenant_id)
  ↓
assignments (tenant_id FK)
```

**Key Points:**
- Students belong to tenants directly
- Submissions belong to students (indirect tenant relationship)
- Assignments belong to tenants directly
- All queries join through students to filter by tenant

---

## Error Handling

### 401 Unauthorized
**When**: Missing, invalid, or expired token  
**Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "Authentication required"
}
```

### 404 Not Found
**When**: Resource doesn't exist OR doesn't belong to tenant  
**Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "Submission not found or access denied"
}
```

**Note**: We use 404 instead of 403 to avoid tenant enumeration attacks.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Required

The following indexes should exist for optimal performance:

```sql
-- Students by tenant (for filtering)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_students_tenant 
ON grader.students(tenant_id);

-- Assignments by tenant (for filtering)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assignments_tenant 
ON grader.assignments(tenant_id);

-- Submissions by student (for joins)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_submissions_student 
ON grader.submissions(student_ref);
```

**Status**: ✅ These indexes were added in the auth migration

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ **All endpoints now require authentication**

**Before**: Endpoints worked without authentication  
**After**: All endpoints return 401 without valid token

### Migration Path

1. ✅ Phase 1: Add authentication system
2. ✅ Phase 4: Protect all endpoints (CURRENT)
3. ⏳ Frontend: Update API calls to include tokens
4. ⏳ Testing: Verify tenant isolation
5. ⏳ Deploy: Push to production

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Frontend)
1. **Update API client** to include Authorization header
2. **Handle 401 responses** (redirect to login)
3. **Test all API calls** with authentication
4. **Verify tenant isolation** works correctly

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add rate limiting per tenant
- [ ] Add API usage analytics per tenant
- [ ] Add admin endpoints for tenant management
- [ ] Add webhook support for tenant events
