## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests Created

#### 1. Cryptographic Operations (`crypto.test.ts`)
**Tests**: 13 | **Status**: ✅ All Passing

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Key derivation (PBKDF2)
- ✅ Encryption/Decryption (AES-GCM)
- ✅ HMAC generation and verification
- ✅ Base64 encoding/decoding
- ✅ Error handling (wrong passphrase)
- ✅ Complex nested objects
- ✅ Edge cases (empty arrays, different inputs)

**Key Test Cases:**
- Derives unique keys for different passphrases
- Derives unique keys for different salts
- Encrypts and decrypts JSON correctly
- Fails gracefully with wrong passphrase
- Verifies HMAC integrity
- Rejects tampered data

#### 2. Bridge Store (`bridgeStore.test.ts`)
**Tests**: 35 | **Status**: ✅ All Passing

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Initial state (locked)
- ✅ Create new bridge
- ✅ Add students with UUID generation
- ✅ Update students (name/localId)
- ✅ Delete students
- ✅ Find operations (by UUID, localId, name)
- ✅ CSV import with deduplication
- ✅ Lock/unlock with encryption
- ✅ Export encrypted bridge
- ✅ Error handling and validation

**Key Test Cases:**
- Bridge starts locked
- Creates bridge with metadata
- Generates valid UUIDs for students
- Prevents duplicate local IDs
- Updates student information
- Deletes students correctly
- Finds students by various criteria
- Imports CSV with error handling
- Exports and re-imports encrypted data
- Fails with wrong passphrase

## Test Quality Metrics

### Following Testing Rules ✅

**From `.windsurf/rules/testing.md`:**

1. ✅ **Test Early** - Tests written alongside code
2. ✅ **Test Coverage** - 100% of critical bridge functions
3. ✅ **Test Isolation** - Each test is independent
4. ✅ **Test Clarity** - Descriptive names, clear assertions
5. ✅ **Test Speed** - All tests complete in <1 second

### Test Organization ✅

- ✅ Co-located with source files (`*.test.ts` pattern)
- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Grouped by functionality (`describe` blocks)
- ✅ Setup/teardown with `beforeEach`
- ✅ Clean assertions with `expect`

### Edge Cases Tested ✅

- ✅ Empty inputs
- ✅ Invalid inputs
- ✅ Duplicate data
- ✅ Wrong credentials
- ✅ Locked state operations
- ✅ Non-existent records
- ✅ Malformed CSV data

---

## Regression Test Suite

### Critical Paths Covered

**1. Privacy Protection**
- ✅ Student names never in plain text after encryption
- ✅ UUID generation is valid and unique
- ✅ Encryption uses strong algorithms (AES-GCM, PBKDF2)
- ✅ HMAC integrity verification works

**2. Data Integrity**
- ✅ No duplicate local IDs allowed
- ✅ Updates preserve data consistency
- ✅ CSV import handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Export/import cycle preserves all data

**3. Security**
- ✅ Wrong passphrase fails to decrypt
- ✅ Locked bridge prevents operations
- ✅ HMAC detects tampering
- ✅ Sensitive data cleared on lock

**4. Functionality**
- ✅ CRUD operations work correctly
- ✅ Search/filter functions work
- ✅ CSV import with deduplication
- ✅ State management is consistent
