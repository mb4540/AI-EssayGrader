  *Detailed Breakdown*
  Detailed Breakdown
BulletProof

**ideas_development**
17.5/25pts
Developing
The essay presents three distinct ideas for comparison (boundaries, classification as mammals, and being endangered), but they are not fully developed. For example, the point about being mammals is based on the vague idea of 'blood that is flowing through you' and birth method, which is an oversimplification and lacks accurate scientific detail. The comparison of humans being endangered due to 'natural causes like wildfires' with tigers being endangered due to hunters is a faulty analogy, as humans as a species are not endangered. The ideas are present but require more depth, accuracy, and supporting evidence to meet expectations.

**focus_organization**
17.5/25pts
Developing
The essay demonstrates a clear focus, stating the three main points in the introduction and restating them in the conclusion. However, the organization is weak. All three main points are presented in a single, long body paragraph (line 3) without clear transitions or separation. This lack of paragraphing makes the essay difficult to follow and disrupts the logical flow of the argument. For instance, the essay abruptly shifts from the topic of birth to the topic of endangerment with the phrase '.Endangered?'.

**authors_craft**
12.5/25pts
Beginning
The author's craft is below expectations. The tone is overly informal and conversational (e.g., 'what if I where to tell u,' 'I'm going to have to break the news'). Sentence structure is a significant issue, with multiple long, run-on sentences that are difficult to parse, such as the opening sentence. Word choice is often imprecise or incorrect (e.g., 'not being a species in total'). The writing does not effectively engage the reader or convey the information clearly.

**conventions**
12.5/25pts
Beginning
The essay contains numerous and frequent errors in conventions that significantly impede readability. There are multiple spelling errors ('characrasteics,' 'where' for 'were,' 'u' for 'you'), grammatical mistakes (incorrect use of 'our' for 'are,' 'they' for 'their'), and punctuation issues. For example, 'when a humans boundaries our crossed they are known to lash out our even murder a person.' These errors are pervasive throughout the short text, indicating a need for significant improvement in proofreading and editing.

Line 1:
Mechanics - "It may be hard to be alive but as humans we share many characrasteics as tigers such as our way of showing our boundaries or being classified in the same group because of how we are born or our blood type and lastly being on the verge of not being a species in total due to natural causes ." → This is a run-on sentence. Consider breaking it into two or more shorter, clearer sentences to improve readability.
Line 1:
AUTHOR'S CRAFT - "It may be hard to be alive but as humans we share many characrasteics" → This is a run-on sentence. Break it into two or three shorter, more direct sentences to improve clarity. For example: 'While life can be challenging, humans share surprising characteristics with tigers. These include...'
Line 1:
CONVENTIONS - "characrasteics as tigers" → The correct spelling is 'characteristics.' Always proofread your work to catch spelling errors.
Line 1:
Mechanics - "characrasteics" → This word is misspelled. The correct spelling is 'characteristics'.
Line 1:
IDEAS & DEVELOPMENT - "our blood type" → This is scientifically inaccurate. Instead of 'blood type,' consider a more accurate shared trait of mammals, such as 'being warm-blooded' or 'having hair or fur,' to strengthen your argument.
Line 1:
AUTHOR'S CRAFT - "not being a species in total" → This phrasing is unclear. Use more precise terminology to convey your meaning, such as 'facing the threat of extinction' or 'being an endangered species.'
Line 3:
FOCUS & ORGANIZATION - "As humans boundaries are usually a big part of our life it determines" → This entire section combines three distinct points into one long paragraph. Separating each main idea into its own paragraph will create a more logical flow and strengthen the overall organization of your essay.
Line 3:
Mechanics - "or they boundary" → The word 'they' is a pronoun. To show possession, use 'their'. The correct phrase is 'or their boundary'.
Line 3:
Mechanics - "if a tiger where to sneak into there boundary" → There are two errors here. 'where' should be 'were', and 'there' should be 'their' to show possession.
Line 3:
CONVENTIONS - "if a tiger where to sneak into there boundary" → There are two errors here. Use 'were' for a hypothetical situation (if a tiger were) and 'their' to show possession (their boundary).
Line 3:
Mechanics - "when a humans boundaries our crossed they are known to lash out our even murder a person." → The word 'our' shows possession. The word you need here is 'are'. The sentence should read: '...boundaries are crossed they are known to lash out or even...'
Line 3:
CONVENTIONS - "a humans boundaries our crossed" → The correct word here is 'are' (a form of the verb 'to be'), not 'our' (a possessive pronoun). The sentence should read: 'a human's boundaries are crossed.'
Line 3:
FOCUS & ORGANIZATION - "You may think that we are fairly far from being classified" → Start a new paragraph here. Each of your main ideas (boundaries, classification, endangerment) should be in its own separate paragraph to improve the essay's structure and make it easier for the reader to follow.
Line 3:
AUTHOR'S CRAFT - "what if I where to tell u that" → This language is too informal for an essay. Rephrase this to sound more academic. For example, instead of asking a question, make a direct statement: 'Furthermore, both humans and tigers are biologically classified as mammals.'
Line 3:
Mechanics - "what if I where to tell u" → For academic writing, use the full word 'you' instead of 'u'. Also, 'where' should be 'were'.
Line 3:
Content - "the blood that is flowing through you makes you and tigers both considered mammals" → This is an inaccurate oversimplification. Being a mammal is defined by characteristics like having hair/fur, being warm-blooded, and females producing milk, not by blood type.
Line 3:
FOCUS & ORGANIZATION - "a tiger gives birth .Endangered?" → This is an abrupt transition. Create a new paragraph for this topic and use a transition sentence to smoothly connect it to the previous point. For example: 'In addition to biological similarities, both species also face threats to their survival.'
Line 3:
Organization - "a tiger gives birth .Endangered?" → This is an abrupt and confusing transition between ideas. Start a new paragraph for your new point about endangerment and introduce it with a clear topic sentence.
Line 3:
Content - "this word can also be used for humans by the second humans are dying through natural cause like wildfires" → This comparison is misleading. While human populations can be threatened by disasters, the human species as a whole is not considered 'endangered' in the same way as tigers, who face extinction.
Line 3:
IDEAS & DEVELOPMENT - "humans are dying through natural cause like wildfires" → This comparison is a faulty analogy. While individuals face threats, the human species is not endangered. To improve this point, you could either choose a different, more accurate point of comparison or reframe the argument entirely.
Line 5:
Mechanics - "we share characterics" → This word is misspelled. The correct spelling is 'characteristics'.
