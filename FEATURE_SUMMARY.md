### 6. **AI Settings Modal with Live Prompt Customization**
**Purpose:** Allow teachers to customize AI behavior on-the-fly

**Frontend Components:**
- Created `SettingsModal.tsx` with 3 tabs (Grading, OCR, Rubric)
- Added gear icon to Dashboard header
- Created `prompts.ts` utility for managing custom prompts
- Each tab has "Reset to Default" button
- Save/Cancel functionality with change tracking

**Backend Integration:**
- Updated `grade.ts` to accept and use `grading_prompt`
- Updated `enhance-text.ts` to accept and use `ocr_prompt`
- Updated `enhance-rubric.ts` to accept and use `rubric_prompt`
- All functions fall back to default prompts if not provided

**API Updates:**
- `gradeSubmission()` sends custom grading prompt
- `VerbatimViewer` sends custom OCR prompt
- `CriteriaInput` sends custom rubric prompt
- `CreateAssignmentModal` sends custom rubric prompt

**How It Works:**
1. User edits prompts in Settings modal
2. Prompts saved to localStorage
3. Frontend reads prompts and sends with each API request
4. Backend uses custom prompt OR falls back to default
5. Changes take effect immediately - no deployment needed

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Works in both localhost and production
- ‚úÖ No code deployment needed to change prompts
- ‚úÖ Teachers can experiment with different approaches
- ‚úÖ Each browser can have different settings
- ‚úÖ Instant feedback on prompt changes
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback to defaults

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Using the Safe Release Script
```bash
# Ensure you're on feature/next-enhancements branch
git checkout feature/next-enhancements

# Run the promotion script
./scripts/backup_and_promote.sh

# This will:
# 1. Create backup of main (WorkingSoftwareCKPoint-TIMESTAMP)
# 2. Merge feature/next-enhancements into main
# 3. Push to GitHub
# 4. Create new feature branch for next work
```

### Option 2: Manual Promotion
```bash
# Ensure working tree is clean
git status

# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch
git merge --no-ff feature/next-enhancements

# Push to GitHub (triggers Netlify deployment)
git push origin main

# Create next feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-next-feature
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check Netlify deployment status
2. Verify all features work on production site
3. Test AI Settings modal
4. Test image uploads in all modes
5. Test delete assignment feature
6. Verify custom prompts work in production

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Custom Prompts
- Prompts are stored in localStorage (browser-specific)
- Each teacher's browser has independent settings
- Consider adding export/import functionality
- Consider server-side storage for team sharing

### Potential Enhancements
- Add prompt templates library
- Add prompt versioning/history
- Add prompt sharing between teachers
- Add prompt analytics (which prompts work best)
- Add A/B testing framework for prompts

### Known Limitations
- Prompts don't sync across devices
- No prompt backup/restore mechanism
- No prompt validation (user can enter invalid prompts)
