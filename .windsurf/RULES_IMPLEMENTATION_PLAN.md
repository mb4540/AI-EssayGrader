# Windsurf Rules Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to create comprehensive rule files for the FastAI Grader project.

## Overview

We will create 6 additional rule files to guide AI assistance and maintain code quality:

1. API Design (Netlify Functions structure)
2. Frontend Components (React patterns)
3. Testing Guidelines
4. Security Best Practices
5. Code Style Conventions
6. Git Workflow

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Backend & Infrastructure (Priority: High)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

#### 1. API Design Rules
**File**: `.windsurf/rules/api-design.md`

**Purpose**: Standardize Netlify Functions structure and API patterns

**Contents**:
- Function structure and organization
- Request/response patterns
- Error handling standards
- Status codes and error messages
- Database query patterns
- OpenAI integration patterns
- CORS and headers configuration
- Input validation
- Response formatting
- Common utilities

**Why First**: Backend consistency is critical for reliability

---

#### 2. Security Best Practices
**File**: `.windsurf/rules/security.md`

**Purpose**: Ensure secure coding practices throughout the application

**Contents**:
- Environment variable handling
- API key protection
- SQL injection prevention
- Input sanitization
- Authentication patterns (future)
- Authorization patterns (future)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting considerations
- Data validation

**Why Fourth**: Consistent style makes code easier to read and maintain

---

### Phase 3: Development Process (Priority: Medium-Low)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

#### 5. Testing Guidelines
**File**: `.windsurf/rules/testing.md`

**Purpose**: Establish testing standards and practices

**Contents**:
- Testing philosophy
- Unit testing patterns
- Integration testing
- E2E testing approach
- Test file organization
- Mock data patterns
- Database testing with branches
- API testing
- Frontend component testing
- Coverage requirements
- CI/CD integration

**Why Fifth**: Testing ensures quality but can be added incrementally

---

#### 6. Git Workflow
**File**: `.windsurf/rules/git-workflow.md`

**Purpose**: Standardize version control practices

**Contents**:
- Branch naming conventions
- Commit message format
- PR process and templates
- Code review guidelines
- Merge strategies
- Release process
- Hotfix procedures
- Tag conventions
- .gitignore best practices
- Conflict resolution

**Why Last**: Workflow can be refined as team grows

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### For Each Rule File:

#### Step 1: Create File Structure
```bash
touch .windsurf/rules/[rule-name].md
```

#### Step 2: Add Header and Overview
```markdown
# [Rule Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what this rule file covers and why it's important.

## Table of Contents
- [Section 1]
- [Section 2]
...
```

#### Step 3: Document Current Patterns
Review existing code to document what's already being done well.

#### Step 4: Add Best Practices
Include industry standards and project-specific guidelines.

#### Step 5: Provide Examples
Add code examples showing correct and incorrect patterns.

#### Step 6: Add Common Pitfalls
Document mistakes to avoid.

#### Step 7: Update Master Index
Add reference in `.windsurf/project-rules.md`

#### Step 8: Test with AI
Ask Windsurf questions to verify it uses the new rules.

#### Step 9: Commit to Git
```bash
git add .windsurf/rules/[rule-name].md
git commit -m "Add [rule name] guidelines"
```
