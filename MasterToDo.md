## 🔥 CRITICAL - Beta Tester Feedback (October 30, 2025)

### 1. Point-Based Scoring System ⭐⭐⭐ ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Support flexible point allocation for essays (full or partial assignments)

**Status:** ✅ **FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE** - Implemented via Total Points UI

**Implementation:**
Teachers can now set any point total (60, 80, 100, 150, etc.) via the "Total Points" field in Grading Criteria. The system automatically:
- Distributes points across rubric categories
- Displays scores as points (e.g., "Organization: 12.8/15 pts")
- Shows total score in points (e.g., "85.17/100" or "48/60")
- Provides percentage for gradebook (e.g., "85.17%")
- Generates rubrics with correct total via Enhance With AI
- Validates math with auto-scaling if needed

**Completed Features:**
- [x] Total Points input field in Grading Criteria header
- [x] Works in Create Assignment modal and Grade Submission page
- [x] Rubric distributes points across categories correctly
- [x] Display category scores as points (e.g., "Organization: 12/15 pts")
- [x] Display total essay score as points (e.g., "Essay: 48/60 pts")
- [x] Percentage shown for gradebook entry (e.g., "80%")
- [x] AI grading prompt works with any point total
- [x] Database stores scoring mode and total_points
- [x] BulletProof calculator handles any point total with Decimal precision

**Database Implementation:**
```sql
-- Already exists from BulletProof Grading migration
ALTER TABLE grader.assignments
ADD COLUMN scale_mode text CHECK (scale_mode IN ('percent', 'points')) DEFAULT 'percent',
ADD COLUMN total_points numeric(10,4);
```

**Note:** The requested "partial assignment toggle" UI was not implemented. Instead, a simpler approach was used: teachers just set the Total Points field to whatever the essay is worth (60, 80, 100, etc.). This achieves the same functionality with less UI complexity. Can be enhanced based on beta tester feedback if needed.

**Completed:** October 31, 2025 (as part of BulletProof Grading implementation)

---

### 2. BulletProof Grading with Python Calculator ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Goal:** Eliminate float math errors and ensure deterministic, auditable grading by using Python Decimal-based calculator

**Background:** Current LLM-based grading has potential numerical inaccuracies due to:
- Float arithmetic errors (0.30000000000000004)
- LLM attempting to do math (inconsistent)
- No audit trail for calculations
- No validation of computed scores

**Solution: Agentic Architecture**
> **"LLM for language, tools for math."**

**Architecture:**
```
Load Rubric → LLM Extractor (JSON only) → Python Calculator (Decimal math) → Save Audit Trail
```

**Key Components:**
1. **LLM Extractor** - Outputs structured JSON with per-criterion scores and rationales (NO totals)
2. **Python Calculator** - Deterministic Decimal-based math for totals, scaling, rounding
3. **Validator** - Schema enforcement, range checks, retry logic
4. **Audit Trail** - Store rubric JSON, extracted scores, computed scores, calculator version

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create Python calculator module with Decimal math
- [x] Implement percent mode: `(raw / max) * 100`
- [x] Implement points mode: `(raw / max) * total_points`
- [x] Add rounding modes: HALF_UP, HALF_EVEN, HALF_DOWN
- [x] Create unit tests for calculator (all edge cases) - 17/17 passing
- [x] Port calculator to TypeScript with decimal.js - 17/17 tests passing
- [x] Design LLM extractor prompt (strict JSON output)
- [x] Create rubric builder for backward compatibility
- [x] Integrate calculator with grading workflow (grade-bulletproof.ts)
- [x] Add audit trail storage (extracted_scores + computed_scores + calculator_version)
- [x] Update frontend to display computed breakdown (GradePanel.tsx)
- [x] Switch API to use bulletproof endpoint
- [x] Fix rubric parser (auto-scaling, category/level detection)
- [x] Implement structured outputs contract for Enhance With AI
- [x] Add Total Points UI control
- [x] Reorganize feedback UI with individual cards
- [x] Fix database persistence (get-submission fetches bulletproof data)
- [x] End-to-end testing with sample essays
- [x] Deploy to production (2 SafeCodeReleases completed)
- [ ] Beta test with Shana

**Status:** ✅ **100% COMPLETE** - Deployed to Production  
**Commits:** 30+ | **Tests:** All Passing | **Build:** ✅ Passing | **Deployed:** ✅ Live

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE grader.assignments
ADD COLUMN rubric_json jsonb,
ADD COLUMN scale_mode text CHECK (scale_mode IN ('percent', 'points')) DEFAULT 'percent',
ADD COLUMN total_points numeric(10,4),
ADD COLUMN rounding_mode text DEFAULT 'HALF_UP',
ADD COLUMN rounding_decimals integer DEFAULT 2;

ALTER TABLE grader.submissions
ADD COLUMN computed_scores jsonb,
ADD COLUMN calculator_version text;
```

**Files:** 
- New: `netlify/functions/python/calculator.py`
- New: `netlify/functions/python/models.py` (Pydantic schemas)
- New: `netlify/functions/python/validator.py`
- New: `netlify/functions/python/test_calculator.py`
- New: `src/lib/prompts/extractor.ts`
- Update: `netlify/functions/grade.ts`
- Update: `src/pages/Submission.tsx`
- Database migration: `migrations/add_bulletproof_grading.sql`

**Time:** 20-26 hours (over 2-3 weeks)

**Implementation Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Python calculator + unit tests (6-9 hours)
- **Phase 2:** LLM integration + validation (5-7 hours)
- **Phase 3:** Integration + testing (5-6 hours)
- **Phase 4:** Audit trail + monitoring (3-4 hours)

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Zero float errors (0.30000000000000004 eliminated)
- ✅ 100% audit trail coverage
- ✅ Deterministic scoring (same input = same output)
- ✅ < 5 seconds per essay
- ✅ Matches manual grading within 2%

**Integration with Point-Based Scoring:**
- BulletProofing provides the **backend calculator**
- Point-Based Scoring provides the **UI toggle**
- Both share `scale_mode` and `total_points` database fields
- Implement BulletProofing calculator FIRST, then Point-Based Scoring UI

**Detailed Plan:** See `/BulletProofing.md`

### 3. Expand Assignment Types & Subject Areas ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Goal:** Support comprehensive document types across all subject areas (not just essays)

**Background:** Teachers need to grade various writing types beyond essays, specific to their subject area (ELA, History, Science, Math, CTE, Arts, Health/PE).

**Document Type Hierarchy:**
We'll use a programmatic JSON structure to define:
- **25 document types** (argumentative, informational, research report, narrative, lab report, etc.)
- **7 subject areas** (English/ELA, History/Social Studies, Science, Math, CTE/Engineering, Arts, Health/PE)
- **Subject-specific document types** (each subject shows only relevant types)
- **Aliases** for common terms (persuasive → argumentative, book report → book review, etc.)

**JSON Structure:** (stored in `src/lib/documentTypes.json`)
```json

### 4. Update Essay Grading Prompt - Professional Tone ⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Goal:** Change grading tone from "encouraging" to "constructive and professional"

**Background:** Beta tester feedback: "Constructive Criticism does not need to be rainbows butterflies and unicorns." Teachers want direct, honest feedback that follows the rubric strictly.

**Current Prompt (in SettingsModal.tsx):**
```
You are an encouraging 6th-grade ELA grader. Grade fairly to the teacher's criteria. 
Preserve the student's original words; do not rewrite their essay. Provide concise, 
supportive feedback that points to specific issues (grammar, spelling, capitalization, 
sentence structure, organization, evidence, clarity). Never include personal data about 
the student.
```

**Issues with Current Prompt:**
- ❌ "encouraging" - too soft, not direct enough
- ❌ "supportive" - implies sugar-coating
- ❌ Doesn't emphasize strict rubric adherence
- ❌ Too lenient in grading approach

**New Prompt (Professional & Constructive):**
```
You are a professional writing evaluator. Grade strictly according to the provided rubric 
and teacher's criteria. Preserve the student's original words; do not rewrite their work. 
Provide clear, direct, constructive feedback that identifies specific issues with concrete 
examples from the text. Focus on: grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, sentence 
structure, organization, evidence quality, and clarity. Be honest about weaknesses while 
acknowledging strengths. Use professional language appropriate for educational feedback. 
Never include personal data about the student.
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ "professional writing evaluator" (not "encouraging grader")
- ✅ "Grade strictly according to rubric" (tighten criteria)
- ✅ "clear, direct, constructive" (not "supportive")
- ✅ "Be honest about weaknesses" (no sugar-coating)
- ✅ "concrete examples from the text" (specific feedback)
- ✅ Maintains respect and professionalism

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update `DEFAULT_GRADING_PROMPT` in `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx`
- [ ] Add migration note for existing users (prompt stored in localStorage)
- [ ] Update any documentation referencing the prompt
- [ ] Test with sample essays to verify tone is appropriate
- [ ] Consider adding "Reset to Default" reminder for existing users

**Additional Considerations:**
- [ ] Add prompt preset options? (Encouraging, Professional, Strict)
- [ ] Allow grade-level adjustment in prompt? (6th grade vs high school)
- [ ] Document type should influence tone? (creative writing vs research paper)

**Files:** 
- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` (line 14: DEFAULT_GRADING_PROMPT)
- `netlify/functions/grade.ts` (uses prompt from localStorage or default)

**Time:** 1-2 hours

**Note:** This change affects the default prompt. Users who have customized their prompt will keep their version unless they click "Reset to Default."

---

### 5. Add "Clean Text" Feature for Copy-Pasted PDF Content ⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Goal:** Clean up markdown artifacts and formatting issues when teachers paste text from PDFs

**Background:** When teachers copy/paste text from PDF documents into the TEXT tab, markdown elements and formatting artifacts appear that are problematic for both the user and the LLM grading.

**Current State:**
- ✅ "Enhance Text" button exists for IMAGE tab (OCR cleanup)
- ❌ No cleanup option for TEXT tab (pasted content)
- ❌ PDF artifacts (markdown chars, formatting issues) remain in pasted text

**Problem Examples:**
- Markdown characters: `**`, `__`, `#`, `*`, `-`, `|`
- Extra spaces and line breaks
- Special characters from PDF encoding
- Formatting artifacts that confuse the LLM

**Solution:**
Add "Clean Text" button to TEXT tab that uses the existing OCR cleanup prompt to remove artifacts.

**UI Changes:**
```
TEXT Tab (before):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Paste student essay here...        │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
[Use This Text]

TEXT Tab (after):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Paste student essay here...        │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
[Clean Text]  [Use This Text]
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add "Clean Text" button to TEXT tab (similar to "Enhance Text" on IMAGE tab)
- [ ] Reuse existing OCR cleanup prompt from SettingsModal
- [ ] Call `enhance-text` function with pasted text
- [ ] Replace textarea content with cleaned text
- [ ] Show loading state during cleanup
- [ ] Add tooltip: "Remove PDF artifacts and formatting issues"
- [ ] Optional: Auto-detect common PDF artifacts and suggest cleanup

**Reuse Existing Code:**
- OCR cleanup prompt: `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` (DEFAULT_OCR_PROMPT)
- Enhance text function: `netlify/functions/enhance-text.ts`
- Similar UI pattern: IMAGE tab "Enhance Text" button

**Files:** 
- `src/pages/Submission.tsx` (add button to TEXT tab)
- `netlify/functions/enhance-text.ts` (already exists, reuse)
- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` (OCR prompt already exists)

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Implementation Notes:**
- Button should be positioned next to "Use This Text" button
- Use same green styling as "Enhance Text" on IMAGE tab
- Show word count before/after cleanup
- Consider adding "Undo" option if cleanup removes too much

---

### 6. Anchor Chart Integration ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY - BLOCKED
**Goal:** Support district-provided anchor charts that guide grading (with flexibility for variation from rubrics)

**Background:** Districts provide anchor charts that don't 100% match the rubrics they supply. Teachers need to reference these during grading.

**Reference:** "look in back of the class see page 50 of student edition book"

**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - Need sample anchor chart from Shana

**Questions to Answer Before Implementation:**
1. What format is the anchor chart? (PDF, image, text, table?)
2. How does it differ from the rubric?
3. Should it be stored per assignment or per teacher?
4. Should it override rubric or supplement it?
5. How should AI incorporate anchor chart guidance?
6. Is it a reference document or active grading criteria?

**Potential Implementation:**
- [ ] Add "Anchor Chart" field to assignment (optional)
- [ ] Support text input, file upload, or both
- [ ] Display anchor chart alongside rubric during grading
- [ ] Include anchor chart context in AI grading prompt
- [ ] Add note about acceptable variation from rubric
- [ ] Store in database or as file reference

**Database Changes (tentative):**
```sql
ALTER TABLE grader.assignments
ADD COLUMN anchor_chart text,
ADD COLUMN anchor_chart_file_url text;
```

**Files (tentative):** 
- `src/components/CreateAssignmentModal.tsx`
- `src/pages/Submission.tsx`
- `netlify/functions/grade.ts`
- Database migration: `migrations/add_anchor_chart.sql`

**Time:** 3-4 hours (after receiving sample)

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Get sample anchor chart from Shana
- [ ] Review page 50 of student edition book
- [ ] Determine format and usage pattern
- [ ] Spec out exact implementation

---

### 7. PDF Annotation with Inline Feedback ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY - COMPLEX
**Goal:** Overlay feedback directly on student work using traditional teacher markup symbols

**Background:** Teachers want to "circle spelling and punctuation" and mark up student work like traditional grading. Feedback should be attached to specific portions of the original text.

**Teacher Quote:** "Circle spelling and punctuation"

**Requirements:**
- Identify specific locations in original text where issues occur
- Attach comments to specific portions of text
- Overlay feedback on PDF (if PDF submission)
- Use traditional teacher markup symbols
- Provide "markup key" for students to understand shorthand

**Traditional Teacher Markup Symbols (to research):**
- sp (spelling error)
- ^ (insert word/punctuation)
- ¶ (new paragraph needed)
- cap (capitalization)
- frag (sentence fragment)
- ro (run-on sentence)
- awk (awkward phrasing)
- ? (unclear meaning)
- ✓ (good point)
- Others to be determined

**Questions to Answer Before Implementation:**
1. Should this work for all submission types or just PDFs?
2. How should LLM identify text locations? (character positions, line numbers, text matching?)
3. What PDF annotation library should we use? (pdf-lib, PDFKit, other?)
4. Should markup be interactive or static?
5. How detailed should the markup key be?
6. Should students see markup key automatically or on request?
7. Should teachers be able to customize markup symbols?
8. How to handle handwritten submissions (images)?

**Research Needed:**
- [ ] Ask LLM for comprehensive list of traditional teacher markup symbols
- [ ] Research PDF annotation libraries (pdf-lib, PDFKit, pdf.js)
- [ ] Determine how to map feedback to text locations
- [ ] Design markup key format (legend, guide, reference sheet)
- [ ] Test with various PDF formats and layouts

**Potential Implementation:**
- [ ] Modify AI prompt to return feedback with text locations
- [ ] Return feedback with character positions or line numbers
- [ ] Implement PDF annotation library
- [ ] Overlay markup symbols and comments on PDF
- [ ] Generate annotated PDF for download
- [ ] Create student-facing "markup key" component
- [ ] Add markup key to Help page or as modal
- [ ] Support both inline symbols and margin comments

**Technical Challenges:**
- Text location identification (especially for handwritten/OCR text)
- PDF layout preservation during annotation
- Symbol placement accuracy
- Multi-page document handling
- File size management for annotated PDFs

**Database Changes:**
```sql
-- Store markup data with submission
ALTER TABLE grader.submissions
ADD COLUMN markup_data jsonb,
ADD COLUMN annotated_pdf_url text;

-- Markup data structure:
-- {
--   "markups": [
--     {
--       "type": "spelling",
--       "symbol": "sp",
--       "location": { "page": 1, "x": 100, "y": 200 },
--       "text": "teh",
--       "comment": "Check spelling"
--     }
--   ]
-- }
```

**Files:** 
- `netlify/functions/grade.ts` (AI prompt modification for location data)
- `src/pages/Submission.tsx` (display annotated PDF)
- New: `src/lib/pdfAnnotation.ts` (PDF annotation logic)
- New: `src/components/MarkupKey.tsx` (student reference guide)
- New: `netlify/functions/annotate-pdf.ts` (generate annotated PDF)

**Time:** 8-12 hours (complex feature)

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Phase 1:** LLM returns feedback with text locations (2-3 hours)
2. **Phase 2:** PDF annotation library integration (3-4 hours)
3. **Phase 3:** Markup symbol system and key (2-3 hours)
4. **Phase 4:** Testing and refinement (1-2 hours)

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Research and select PDF annotation library
- [ ] Create comprehensive markup symbol list
- [ ] Design markup key format
- [ ] Prototype text location identification

- Extract reusable logic to hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow existing code style patterns
- Add comments for complex logic

### Testing Checklist
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Test on mobile viewport
- Test with real data (multiple students, assignments)
- Test edge cases (empty states, errors)
- Test keyboard navigation
- Test screen reader compatibility
