## üìù Development Notes

### Best Practices
- Start with high-priority items first
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to next
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Update this TODO as you progress
- Move incomplete items back to FUTURE_WORK.md if needed

### File Organization
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow existing code style patterns
- Add comments for complex logic

### Testing Checklist
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Test on mobile viewport
- Test with real data (multiple students, assignments)
- Test edge cases (empty states, errors)
- Test keyboard navigation
- Test screen reader compatibility
