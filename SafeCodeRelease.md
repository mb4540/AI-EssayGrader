## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration

### Migration Script
**File:** `migrations/add_annotations_table.sql`

```sql
-- Create annotations table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS grader.annotations (
  annotation_id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  submission_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES grader.submissions(submission_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  line_number integer NOT NULL,
  start_offset integer NOT NULL,
  end_offset integer NOT NULL,
  quote text NOT NULL,
  category text NOT NULL,
  suggestion text NOT NULL,
  severity text,
  status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ai_suggested',
  ai_payload jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_annotations_submission ON grader.annotations(submission_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_annotations_status ON grader.annotations(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_annotations_line ON grader.annotations(submission_id, line_number);

-- Add trigger for updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER trg_annotations_updated
BEFORE UPDATE ON grader.annotations
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION grader.update_timestamp();
```

### Migration Steps
1. **Backup database** (Neon automatic backups enabled)
2. **Run migration** in Neon SQL Editor
3. **Verify tables created:** `\dt grader.annotations`
4. **Verify indexes:** `\di grader.idx_annotations_*`
5. **Test with sample data**

### Rollback Plan
```sql
-- If rollback needed
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS grader.annotations CASCADE;
```

**Impact:** No data loss - new table only, no modifications to existing tables

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify all tests passing locally
- [ ] Verify build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] Review git log for unexpected changes
- [ ] Ensure `feature/inline-annotations` branch is up to date

### 2. Database Migration (5 minutes)
- [ ] Log into Neon dashboard
- [ ] Open SQL Editor for production database
- [ ] Run migration script from `migrations/add_annotations_table.sql`
- [ ] Verify table created: `SELECT * FROM grader.annotations LIMIT 1;`
- [ ] Verify indexes: `\di grader.idx_annotations_*`

### 3. Code Deployment (10 minutes)
- [ ] Push branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature/inline-annotations`
- [ ] Open Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to Deploys
- [ ] Click "Deploy" on `feature/inline-annotations` branch
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (~3-5 minutes)
- [ ] Monitor build logs for errors

### 4. Smoke Testing (10 minutes)
- [ ] Open production site
- [ ] Test basic grading workflow:
  - [ ] Create new submission
  - [ ] Paste essay text
  - [ ] Grade essay
  - [ ] Verify annotations appear
  - [ ] Test approve/edit/reject buttons
  - [ ] Test "Approve All" button
  - [ ] Test print with annotations
  - [ ] Verify yellow highlights in PDF

- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test on different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### 5. Monitoring (30 minutes)

- [ ] Monitor database performance in Neon
- [ ] Watch for user reports (if beta testers active)

**Total Deployment Time:** ~60 minutes

## üî• Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Detected

#### Option 1: Revert Deployment (Fastest - 2 minutes)
1. Go to Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Deploys
2. Find previous successful deploy (before this release)
3. Click "Publish deploy"
4. Previous version restored immediately

#### Option 2: Revert Code (5 minutes)
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin feature/inline-annotations

# Netlify auto-deploys
```

#### Option 3: Database Rollback (If needed - 5 minutes)
```sql
-- Remove annotations table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS grader.annotations CASCADE;

-- No other tables affected
```

**Impact of Rollback:**
- ‚úÖ No data loss (annotations table is new)
- ‚úÖ No impact on existing submissions
- ‚úÖ Grading continues to work normally
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Annotations feature unavailable until fixed
