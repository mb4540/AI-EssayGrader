**Last Updated:** 2025-10-08  
**Current Branch:** `feature/additional-enhancements`  
**Status:** Ready for next development session

---

## üî¥ High Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Blob Storage for Image Persistence
**Status:** Not Working  
**Issue:** Images are not being persisted after upload

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check if `ALLOW_BLOB_STORAGE` environment variable is set correctly
- Verify Netlify Blobs configuration
- Test image upload flow in both localhost and production
- Check `upload-image` Netlify function
- Verify database stores image URLs correctly
- Test image retrieval on submission view

**Files to Review:**
- `netlify/functions/upload-image.ts`
- `src/pages/Submission.tsx` (handleTextExtracted, uploadImage)
- `.env` (ALLOW_BLOB_STORAGE setting)
- Netlify environment variables

**Expected Behavior:**
- Upload image ‚Üí OCR extracts text ‚Üí Image stored in Netlify Blobs
- Image URL saved to database
- Image displays on subsequent views of submission
- Works for Single Essay and Draft Comparison modes

### 2. Add Google Cloud Document AI API for OCR
**Status:** Not Started  
**Goal:** Provide alternative to Tesseract.js for better OCR accuracy

**Requirements:**
- Add Google Cloud Document AI as optional OCR provider
- Allow user to choose between Tesseract.js and Google Cloud
- Add settings toggle in Settings modal
- Store API credentials securely
- Maintain backward compatibility with Tesseract.js

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add Google Cloud Document AI SDK to dependencies
2. Create new Netlify function for Google Cloud OCR
3. Add settings option to choose OCR provider
4. Update VerbatimViewer to use selected provider
5. Add Google Cloud API key to environment variables
6. Update documentation

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `netlify/functions/google-ocr.ts` (new)
- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` (add OCR provider toggle)
- `src/components/VerbatimViewer.tsx` (support both providers)
- `.env.example` (add GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY)
- `src/pages/Help.tsx` (document new option)

**Benefits:**
- Better OCR accuracy for handwritten text
- Faster processing
- Support for more languages
- Better handling of complex layouts

- [ ] Review and optimize state management

#### B. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting (reduce bundle size from 940KB)
- [ ] Lazy load routes and heavy components
- [ ] Optimize image loading and caching
- [ ] Review and optimize re-renders

#### C. Type Safety
- [ ] Review all TypeScript types
- [ ] Add missing type definitions
- [ ] Remove any `any` types
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling types

#### D. Code Quality
- [ ] Remove console.logs in production
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to complex functions
- [ ] Standardize error handling
- [ ] Review and improve accessibility

#### E. Testing

- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test edge cases

**Files to Review:**
- All files in `src/components/`
- All files in `src/lib/`
- All files in `netlify/functions/`
- `src/pages/` components

### 4. Add Login and Multi-Tenancy
**Status:** Not Started  
**Goal:** Support multiple teachers with separate data

**Requirements:**

#### A. Authentication
- Choose auth provider (Netlify Identity, Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth)
- Implement login/logout flow
- Protect routes requiring authentication
- Add user profile management

#### B. Multi-Tenancy
- Add `user_id` or `teacher_id` to all database tables
- Filter all queries by current user
- Ensure data isolation between users
- Add user management for admins

#### C. Database Schema Changes
**Tables to Update:**
```sql
-- Add user_id to submissions
ALTER TABLE grader.submissions ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;

-- Add user_id to assignments
ALTER TABLE grader.assignments ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;

-- Create users table (if not using external auth)
CREATE TABLE grader.users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### D. UI Changes
- Add login page
- Add user profile dropdown in header
- Add "My Account" settings page
- Update Dashboard to show only user's submissions
- Add user switcher for admins (optional)

#### E. Security Considerations
- Implement row-level security in database
- Validate user ownership on all API calls
- Prevent cross-user data access
- Secure API endpoints with auth tokens

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/pages/Login.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx` (new)
- `src/lib/auth.ts` (new)
- All Netlify functions (add user validation)
- Database migration scripts
- `src/App.tsx` (add auth context)

**Migration Plan:**
1. Choose and implement auth provider
2. Create users table and migration
3. Add user_id to existing tables
4. Update all API functions to filter by user
5. Add login UI
6. Test thoroughly before production
