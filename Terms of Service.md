If you are agreeing on behalf of a school, district, or other educational organization (each, a “**District**”), you represent that you have authority to bind that organization. If a separate signed agreement is in place with a District, that agreement controls to the extent of conflict.

## 2) The Service

The Service helps educators create lesson plans and score tests/essays. The Service is designed to operate with **UUID-keyed student records** and supports an optional **local bridge file** stored on the teacher’s/District’s device that maps personally identifiable information (“**PII**”) to UUIDs. The Service’s cloud components do **not require** names or local student IDs.

## 3) Eligibility & Accounts

You must be at least 18 or an authorized employee/contractor of a District. You are responsible for safeguarding account credentials and for activities under your account.

## 4) Student Data; FERPA; School-Official Role

4.1 **Definitions.** “**Student Data**” means any information that is directly related to a student and maintained by a District or by the Service on the District’s behalf, including education records under FERPA.
4.2 **School Official.** To the extent the Service processes Student Data, Company acts as a **school official** with **legitimate educational interest** under FERPA, subject to the District placing Company under its **direct control** via these Terms and/or a signed addendum.
4.3 **No Sale/No Ads.** Company does not sell Student Data, use it for behaviorally targeted advertising, or otherwise process it for purposes unrelated to providing the Service.

## 5) Local Bridge File (PII↔UUID)

# Annex A — Student Data Protection Addendum (FERPA)

**This Annex A** applies where Company processes Student Data for a District.

### A1. Roles & Purpose

* **District** is the data controller/educational agency; **Company** is a processor/school official under the **school-official exception** to FERPA, acting under District’s **direct control**.
* Purpose: provide the Service (lesson planning, scoring, feedback, analytics), **UUID-keyed**; Company will not process Student Data for other purposes.

### A2. Local Bridge File

* District maintains a local, encrypted bridge file mapping PII↔UUID; it is **not transmitted** to Company.
* District controls access, backup, retention, and destruction of the bridge file. Company cannot recover student identities if the bridge file is lost.

### A3. Data Handling & PII Hygiene

* **Cloud UUID-only:** Cloud interfaces are designed to accept **UUIDs only**. District will avoid sending PII (names, local IDs) to the Service.
* The Service may implement **client-side redaction** (e.g., renaming files to `{uuid}-{assignmentId}.pdf`, scrubbing metadata).
* Company will promptly notify District if PII is inadvertently received and will cooperate in remediation.

### A4. Security Measures

* **Encryption:** in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest.
* **Access Controls:** role-based access; least privilege; SSO/OAuth where configured by District.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** security logs retained **[90] days**; logs exclude PII to the extent practicable.
* **Backups & DR:** encrypted backups retained **[30–45] days**; tested disaster recovery procedures.
* **Subprocessors:** listed at [subprocessor URL]; written contracts impose equivalent protections.

### A5. Incident Response

* Company will notify District **without undue delay** and no later than **[72 hours]** after confirming a security incident involving Student Data. The notice will include known details, scope, mitigation, and contact for follow-up.

### A6. Student/Parent Rights Assistance

* Company will assist District with access, correction, export, and deletion requests within **[10 business days]** of written request, to the extent feasible. District is the sole arbiter of requests.

### A7. Data Retention & Deletion

* During the term, Company retains Student Data as necessary to provide the Service.
* Upon termination or District request, Company will **delete or return** Student Data within **[30] days**, except for **[30–45] days** in encrypted backups, after which backups are overwritten in the ordinary course. Deletion certificates available upon request.

### A8. De-Identification; Analytics; AI

* Company may use **de-identified** data (stripped of personal identifiers and with reasonable mitigation against re-identification) to maintain, secure, and improve the Service, create statistics, and measure usage.
* **No model training** on Student Data by third parties unless (i) data are de-identified as above, or (ii) District **opts in** via signed addendum specifying scope, retention, and vendors.

### A9. Audits & Compliance

* Upon reasonable notice (no more than once annually and subject to confidentiality), Company will provide a **security overview** and completion of standard security questionnaires; independent reports (e.g., SOC 2) will be shared when available. On-site audits may be mutually agreed and at District’s expense.

### A10. Subprocessors; Location

* Company may engage subprocessors; Company remains liable for their performance. Data may be processed in **[United States]** unless otherwise agreed in writing.

### A11. COPPA & PPRA

* Where COPPA applies outside the school-official context, the District represents it has obtained required consent or is authorized to provide consent on parents’ behalf for school use. For PPRA-covered surveys, District is responsible for required notices/consents.

### A12. Term & Termination

* This Annex remains in force while Company processes Student Data for District and will terminate upon complete deletion/return of Student Data.
